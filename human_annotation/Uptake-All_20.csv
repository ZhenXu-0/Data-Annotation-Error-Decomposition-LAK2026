Remember, Student T, we have to change it from five and six- tenths because I put the decimal in the wrong place, to 56 hundredths. Student T, same thing. We made an error here because I wrote the decimal wrong. Which is a good point, because it just goes to show you that depending on how many places you have behind a decimal will change your answer.
